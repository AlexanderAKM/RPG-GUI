# Role Playing Game

In this project, we made a RPG with GUI to showcase OOP principles in Java. Our precious game is on exploring the university campus. 

Our RPG consists of an Inventory, Locations, Non-player characters (NPCs), and Player classes systems. In addition, the player is able to save and restore their game state at any time.

The game logic itself is independent of the way it is presented to the player. That is, the game follows guidelines of the Model-View-Controller pattern. 

- The program makes proper use of exceptions. That is, exceptions are added where appropriate, without abusing the exception mechanism.
- The game is playable in English and Dutch.
- Each class contains the `@author` Javadoc tag to indicate the main author.
